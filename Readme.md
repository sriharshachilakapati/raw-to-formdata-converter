## Raw to FormData Converter

This is a utility to convert the data from raw data (what you get after importing CURL requests into Postman) into form data (use bulk edit feature and paste it in the Postman).

## Installation

    $ npm i -g raw-to-formdata-converter

### Usage

  1. Run the utility.

         $ raw-to-formdata-converter

  2. When it tells to copy the data, go into Postman and copy the Raw Data.
  3. Press any key and conversion done.
  4. Go back into Postman and paste the converted data in FormData (you need to be in the bulk-edit mode).
  5. Hurrah!!
